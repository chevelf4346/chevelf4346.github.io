        <h1>How I want my Future to Look</h1> 
        <p>In the future, I want to be some form of a doctor. Most likely I'd like to be a pediactric surgeon,but I'm not completely sure if I could handle surgery.Before I thought I wanted to be a detective or a lawyer because of the TV shows I watch(How to Get Away With Murder and Law & Order:SVU). I hope to get married and have children and live in a nice area where I can have a nice life.</p>

        <h3>My Current Life</h3>
        <p>Currently, I live in the Bronx and all I see on my street are people who have the potential to be greater , but they have no motivation to do so. Despite these circumstances, I still have motivation within my family. I go to a school called KIPP ,and it is a pretty good school that encourages us to want to be better.</p>
